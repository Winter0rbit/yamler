# Yamler Development Roadmap

## Current State Analysis

**Project Stats:**
- **Core Code**: 3,270 lines
- **Test Coverage**: 5,196 lines of tests (158% test-to-code ratio)
- **Test Success Rate**: 94.7% (304/321 tests passing)
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (only `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`)

**Current Strengths:**
- âœ… Excellent formatting preservation (custom indentation, comments, structure)
- âœ… Comprehensive type-safe API (getters/setters for all Go types)
- âœ… Advanced array operations with style preservation
- âœ… Wildcard pattern matching (`*`, `**`)
- âœ… Document merging with format preservation
- âœ… Schema validation support
- âœ… Array document roots (Ansible-style)
- âœ… Production-ready error handling

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Priorities

### Phase 1: Fix Current Issues
**Goal**: Reach 98%+ test success rate

#### 1.1 Remaining Test Failures
- [ ] Fix multiline flow objects edge cases
- [ ] Improve error handling for malformed YAML
- [ ] Fix remaining 17 failing tests

#### 1.2 Code Quality
- [ ] Reduce code duplication in core functions
- [ ] Simplify complex functions (>50 lines)
- [ ] Add missing error checks

### Phase 2: Performance Improvements
**Goal**: Handle larger files efficiently

#### 2.1 Basic Optimizations
- [ ] Profile memory usage for large documents
- [ ] Optimize string operations in path parsing
- [ ] Cache frequently accessed nodes
- [ ] Reduce allocations in ToBytes()

#### 2.2 Benchmarks
- [ ] Add benchmarks for all core operations
- [ ] Test with files 1MB+, 10MB+
- [ ] Memory usage profiling

### Phase 3: Enhanced Functionality
**Goal**: Add practical features users need

#### 3.1 Better Path Support
- [ ] Path validation before operations
- [ ] Support for array slice operations (`array[1:3]`)
- [ ] Better error messages for invalid paths

#### 3.2 Utility Methods
- [ ] `HasKey()` method for checking existence
- [ ] `Delete()` method for removing keys
- [ ] `Copy()` method for duplicating documents
- [ ] `Keys()` method for listing all keys

#### 3.3 Format Detection
- [ ] Detect and preserve YAML version (`%YAML 1.1`)
- [ ] Handle document separators (`---`)
- [ ] Preserve custom line endings

### Phase 4: Real-World Integration
**Goal**: Make library production-ready for common use cases

#### 4.1 Common Formats Support
- [ ] Docker Compose advanced features
- [ ] Kubernetes resource improvements
- [ ] GitHub Actions complex workflows
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configurations

#### 4.2 Validation Improvements  
- [ ] Schema validation with better error messages
- [ ] Type checking for common patterns
- [ ] Required field validation

#### 4.3 Import/Export
- [ ] JSON to YAML conversion with formatting
- [ ] Environment variable substitution
- [ ] Configuration templates

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### Code Organization
- [ ] Split large files into smaller modules
- [ ] Better separation of concerns
- [ ] Extract common utilities

### Error Handling
- [ ] More specific error types
- [ ] Better error messages with context
- [ ] Graceful handling of edge cases

### Testing
- [ ] Property-based testing for edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests with real files
- [ ] Performance regression tests

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics

### Quality Targets
- [ ] 98%+ test success rate
- [ ] Handle 10MB+ YAML files
- [ ] Memory usage <2x file size
- [ ] Zero panic conditions

### Practical Goals
- [ ] Works with all common YAML formats
- [ ] Preserves formatting in 95%+ cases
- [ ] Easy to use API
- [ ] Good error messages
